# Working with dates/time in R :alarm_clock: :hourglass: :watch:

The **[CRAN time series task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html)** gives an overview of the R packages that deal with dates and times, particularly for time series analysis. 

This 2014 blogpost on **[Using Dates and Times in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-dates-and-times-in-r/)** describes several common classes of dates, summarized here:

- **Date**: if you have only dates, but no times, in your data
- **POSIXct** (calendar time): if you have times in your data, this is usually the best class to use
- **POSIXlt** (local time, lists): enables easy extraction of specific componants of a time
- **[chron](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chron/chron.pdf)**: good option when you donâ€™t need to deal with timezones or daylight savings
- **[lubridate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html)**: a wrapper for POSIXct with more intuitive syntax (cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/lubridate.pdf))
    - distinguishes between four types of objects: instants, intervals, durations, and periods. An instant is a specific moment in time. Intervals, durations, and periods are all ways of recording time spans

NEON has a **[tutorial series](http://www.neonscience.org/tabular-time-series)** that works through various time types, and includes sample datasets for us to use.

The package **[tibbletime](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/index.html)** was developed for business/finance, but was specifically built to work well with the `tidyverse`.

## Example data

Data packages on the [Arctic Data Center](arcticdata.io):

- [Plot net ecosystem exchange (NEE) from Kangerlussuaq (2012 - 2014 growing seasons)](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#view/doi:10.18739/A2469W)
- [Agashashok Climate Data](https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#view/doi:10.18739/A2FW9K)

Miscellaneous datasets:

- [Seinfeld episodes](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles/data) (date only) :tv:
- [Chicago taxi trips](https://www.kaggle.com/chicago/chicago-taxi-rides-2016/data) :taxi:
- [Seattle library data](https://www.kaggle.com/seattle-public-library/seattle-library-checkout-records/data) :books:
- [Stock market records](https://www.kaggle.com/deeiip/1m-real-time-stock-market-data-nse/data) :moneybag:

- [lubridate cheatsheet](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html) & [R for Data Science chapter on dates/times](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/dates-and-times.html)
- [tibbletime package](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/index.html)
    - [`filter_time()`](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/articles/TT-01-time-based-filtering.html) succinctly filters a tbl_time object by date: `filter_time('2013-03' ~ '2015')`
    - [`as_period()`](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/articles/TT-02-changing-time-periods.html) - converts a tbl_time object from daily to monthly, from minute data to hourly, and more
    - [`rollify()`](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/articles/TT-03-rollify-for-rolling-analysis.html) -  modifies a function so that it calculates a value (or a set of values) at specific time intervals. For example, for a moving average: `rollify(mean, window = 5)`
- [NEON tutorial series](http://www.neonscience.org/tabular-time-series) - starts off in base R and introduces tidyverse methods on 04; discusses methods for subsetting and plotting by date
