The **[CRAN time series task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html)** gives an overview of the R packages that deal with dates and times, particularly for time series analysis. 

This 2014 blogpost on **[Using Dates and Times in R](https://www.r-bloggers.com/using-dates-and-times-in-r/)** describes several common classes of dates, summarized here:

- **Date**: if you have only dates, but no times, in your data
- **POSIXct** (calendar time): if you have times in your data, this is usually the best class to use
- **POSIXlt** (local time, lists): enables easy extraction of specific componants of a time
- **[chron](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/chron/chron.pdf)**: good option when you donâ€™t need to deal with timezones or daylight savings
- **[lubridate](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lubridate/vignettes/lubridate.html)**: a wrapper for POSIXct with more intuitive syntax (cheatsheet [here](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/lubridate.pdf))
    - distinguishes between four types of objects: instants, intervals, durations, and periods. An instant is a specific moment in time. Intervals, durations, and periods are all ways of recording time spans

NEON has a **[tutorial series](http://www.neonscience.org/tabular-time-series)** that works through various time types, and includes sample datasets for us to use.

The package **[tibbletime](https://business-science.github.io/tibbletime/index.html)** was developed for business/finance, but was specifically built to work well with the `tidyverse`.

## Example Data
