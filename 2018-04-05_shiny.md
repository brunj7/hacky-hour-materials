# Shiny
#### _NCEAS Hacky Hour 2018-04-05_

For our Hacky Hour this week, we are extending the Eco-Data-Science session presented by [Ben Best](http://benbestphd.com/). 


## Getting started
If you are new two Shiny, here are two tutorials that walk you through the first steps of building a shiny app:

- [How to Start Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/) by Garrett Grolemund, which includes a video intro ([slides here](https://ucsb-bren.github.io/env-info/wk08_shiny/shiny_lec.pdf))
- [Building Shiny apps - an interactive tutorial](https://deanattali.com/blog/building-shiny-apps-tutorial/) by Dean Attali (blogpost)

If you prefer the dive-right-in kind of approach, check out these examples and start fiddling around:

- [Ben Best's shiny-intro repo](https://github.com/bbest/shiny-intro)
